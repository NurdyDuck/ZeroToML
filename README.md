A beginner-to-advanced journey in machine learning — building core algorithms from scratch with intuition, math, and clean Python code.
🚀 What is ZeroToML?

ZeroToML is a hands-on, code-first roadmap to machine learning.

Instead of just using libraries, you will understand how ML really works by building every major algorithm from scratch, step by step.

This repo includes:

✨ Clean, beginner-friendly explanations

🧠 The intuition behind each algorithm

📐 Math broken down simply

🔬 From-scratch Python implementations

📊 Visualizations and Jupyter notebooks

🗂️ Well-organized folder structure

📚 A clear learning roadmap

🧭 Learning Roadmap

🔹 1. Linear Models

 Simple Linear Regression (OLS)

 Multiple Linear Regression

 Polynomial Regression

🔹 2. Classification Models

 Logistic Regression

 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

 Naive Bayes (Gaussian)

 Support Vector Machine (theory + simplified version)

🔹 3. Tree-Based Models

 Decision Trees

 Random Forest (manual build)

🔹 4. Clustering

 K-Means

 Hierarchical Clustering (intuition + simple code)

🔹 5. Dimensionality Reduction

 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

🔹 6. Bonus

 Train/test splitting by hand

 Metrics from scratch (MSE, accuracy, precision, recall)

 Gradient Descent Visualizations
